What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool developed by HashiCorp that allows you to define, provision, and manage cloud infrastructure using simple, declarative configuration files.
Key Concepts of Terraform:
Term	Meaning
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)	Manage cloud resources using code (instead of manual UI work).
Declarative Syntax	You describe what you want, and Terraform figures out how to achieve it.
Provider	Plugin for managing resources in a specific platform like GCP, AWS, Azure, etc.
Resource	A piece of infrastructure (e.g., VM, bucket, database) that you define in code.
State File (terraform.tfstate)	Terraform tracks the infrastructure it manages using this file.
Modules	Reusable blocks of code to create infrastructure components.

ðŸ“¦ What Can You Do with Terraform?
You can create and manage:

VMs (Compute Engine, EC2, Azure VM)

Networks (VPCs, Subnets, Firewalls)

Databases (Cloud SQL, RDS, CosmosDB)

Buckets (GCS, S3, Azure Blob)

IAM policies, roles, secrets, etc.
